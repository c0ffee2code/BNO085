Rapid moves — IMU tracking under fast oscillation

Setup: BNO085 on lever, AS5600 encoder on rotation axis as reference.
Procedure:
  1. Select report rate (10 Hz or 344 Hz).
  2. Swing lever rapidly from side to side (~1 second per full sweep).
  3. Continue for the full sample count (2000 reports).
  4. Download CSV from Pico flash storage.

Purpose: Measure how well the IMU tracks fast direction changes.
Expected: Higher report rate should reduce phase lag during rapid reversals.
