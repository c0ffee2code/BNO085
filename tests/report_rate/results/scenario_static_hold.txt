Static hold — IMU noise floor and bias at rest

Setup: BNO085 on lever, AS5600 encoder on rotation axis as reference.
       Lever fixed in place with a screwdriver (no jig available).
       Small constant offset from zero is expected in encoder readings — that's fine
       as long as it stays stable throughout the test.
Procedure:
  1. Fix the lever so it cannot move.
  2. Select report rate (10 Hz or 344 Hz).
  3. Let it run for the full sample count (2000 reports) without touching anything.
  4. Download CSV from Pico flash storage.

Purpose: Measure IMU noise floor and confirm the ~2 deg systematic bias seen in motion tests.
Expected:
  - Encoder readings should be nearly constant (confirms lever is fixed).
  - IMU readings should be nearly constant but may differ from encoder by the bias offset.
  - Any spread in IMU readings is the noise floor — the minimum error achievable.
