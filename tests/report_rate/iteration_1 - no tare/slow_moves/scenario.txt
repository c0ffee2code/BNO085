Slow moves — IMU tracking under gentle motion

Setup: BNO085 on lever, AS5600 encoder on rotation axis as reference.
Procedure:
  1. Select report rate (10 Hz or 344 Hz).
  2. Move lever slowly and steadily from one extreme to the other (~5-10 s per sweep).
  3. Continue for the full sample count (2000 reports).
  4. Download CSV from Pico flash storage.

Purpose: Measure steady-state angle accuracy without fast dynamics.
Expected: Both rates should track well; exposes systematic bias and sensor fusion lag.
